# JavaScript Pong – Building a Retro Arcade Classic

This is the source code for a tutorial on my blog. The tutorial is available here...

[JavaScript Pong – Building a Retro Arcade Classic](https://davidreid.blog/javascript-pong-building-a-retro-arcade-classic/)

The tutorial walks through the development of a JavaScript clone of Pong and covers the following topics

+ The game canvas
+ The game loop
+ The special effects (two-dimensional rendering)
+ Event listeners
+ Collision detection
+ Player movement
+ NPC movement
+ Game Screens

The game is a clone for tutorial purposes and you are welcome to download, fork and modify as you see fit.

## Prerequisites and Requirements

To complete the tutorial, all you need is a simple text editor and a browser. I used Visual Studio Code, but any editor will suffice.
The game can run on your browsers `file://` protocol so there are no requirements to host a local server. I used Chrome for the
tutorial I suggest you do the same. The game has not been tested on IE, Safari or Edge.

## Pong.js

There is a more complete version of Pong on my website. You can play it here.

The source code for Pong.js is also available here on my GitHub profile.

Again, you are free to download, fork and/or modify as you see fit.

Enjoy.
